# FEZ Bingo

This repository hosts the rules for playing bingo with the game [FEZ](http://www.fezgame.com/). The rules are in a format that can be understood by [Bingosync](https://bingosync.com), so games can be synced up online.

This bingo still needs some tweaking and balancing, so suggestions are welcome!

Enjoy!

## The Rules

* The bingo game begins on starting a new game in Speedrun mode, at which point the runners should reveal the bingo card
* The bingo game ends when one runner fills in a row, column, or diagonal (beating the game is not required)
* Any square that says "do not X" may be marked completed at the start, then unmarked when a player has done that thing
* Most normal rules of any% apply, specifically:
	* System clock manipulation is banned
	* Cube duplication is banned
	* Reset manipulation is banned
	* Save state manipulation is banned

2. In the "New Room" section, create a room name, password, and give yourself a nickname
